The "Mr. Green" project is an online platform designed to promote environmental sustainability through recycling, event creation, and community engagement. 
In response to challenges such as low awareness, limited infrastructure, and inefficient communication, 
Mr. Green offers innovative solutions including educational campaigns, easy access to unique content, mapping of recycling points, and real-time chat features.

Key functional needs include user participation in events, access to recycling information, the ability to make complaints, information collection, map consultations, and account management. 
To meet non-functional requirements, the platform emphasizes security, performance, scalability, accessibility, and maintainability. 
Developed using Node.js, Express, Angular, MongoDB and Arduino, and supported by tools like Visual Studio Code, Star UML, and Postman, 
Mr. Green provides a dynamic and user-friendly space to support eco-responsibility and inspire daily action towards a cleaner future.
